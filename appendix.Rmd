# Introduction
The following sections contain all computations for the creation of the exploratory data results summarised in the brief paper. Computations are accompanied by references and justifications to clarify any choices made. 

# R Packages
The following R packages are used in the subsequent code sections. 
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(openxlsx)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```
The following code loads a useful function to account for special characters.
```{r}
rep_sp_char <- function(x){
        sp_char <- c("á", "é", "í", "ó", "ñ")
        rep <- c("a", "e", "i", "o", "n")
        for(i in 1:length(rep)){
                x <- gsub(sp_char[i], rep[i], x)}
        return(x)}
```

# Data Extraction
## Data Source and Relevance
The data used is the AMIE survey conducted by INEC (non-summarised). This annual survey collects census data on the number of students and teachers at each Ecuadorian primary and secondary institution. Code books and methodology documents are available in this [online repository](https://educacion.gob.ec/amie/)

## Download
The following code downloads the data.
```{r}
link <- "https://educacion.gob.ec/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=15713"
df <- read.xlsx(link,  sheet = "Registros Administrativos", startRow = 13)
names(df)[2] <- "duplicate" #Rename duplicated column to ensure tidyverse works
names(df) <- tolower(rep_sp_char(names(df)))
```

# Data Cleaning
## Creation of a Tidy Data Frame
The following code selects the columns of interests, translates them and turns them into factors. It should be noted here that column 35 (which is selected) **only** counts students enrolled in primary and secondary education. 
```{r}
df1 <- df %>%
        select("name" = nombre.institucion, 
               "area" = zona.inec, "canton" = canton, 
               "type" = sostenimiento,
               "tot.teachers" = total.docentes,
               "tot.students" = 35) %>%
        mutate(type = factor(tolower(type), levels = c("fiscal", "particular",
                                              "municipal", "fiscomisional"),
                             labels = c("public", "private", "municipal",
                                        "mixed"))) %>%
        mutate(area = factor(str_remove(area, "INEC"), 
               levels = c("Rural", "Urbana"), labels = c("rural", "urban"))) %>%
        mutate(education.level = factor(education.level)) %>%
        mutate(canton = factor(canton)) 
```
The following code book explains the different variables in detail:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
colnames <- c("name", "area", "type", "canton", "tot.teachers", "estimated.5-19.yo", "education.level")
explanation <- c("Institution name", "Indicates whether the institution is in a rural or urban area.", "Indicates how the institution is financed", "Ecuadorian canton name.", "Total number of teachers at the institution", "Total number of students at the institution", "The levels of education provided by the institution")
values <- c("ID as characters", "factor of 2 levels: rural, urban", "factor of 4 levels: public, ...", "factor of 222 levels: LOJA, ...", "numeric", "numeric", "factor of 18 levels, numbers assigned alphabetically")
table <- data.frame(cbind(colnames, explanation, values))
kable(table, caption = "Code Book data frame DF1")
```

## Manipulation of the Data
The following code creates a data frame which calculates the median student-teacher ratio for each canton (rural and urban area). It then creates a data frame which calculates the percentage of students which are enrolled in private schools per canton (rural and urban area). Finally, the two data frames are merged. 

```{r}
missing_to_zero <- function(var){return(ifelse(is.na(var), 0, var))}
not.prim.sec.edu <- c("Alfabetización P.P", "Formación Artística", "Artesanal P.P")

sdf <- df1 %>%
        filter(type == "public" & education.level !=) %>%
        mutate(stratio = tot.students/tot.teachers) %>%
        group_by(canton, area) %>%
        summarise(stratio = median(stratio))

sdf1 <- df1 %>%
        group_by(type, canton, area) %>%
        summarise(n = sum(tot.students)) %>%
        pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = n) %>%
        mutate(public = missing_to_zero(public)) %>%
        mutate(mixed = missing_to_zero(mixed)) %>%
        mutate(municipal = missing_to_zero(municipal)) %>%
        mutate(private = missing_to_zero(private)) %>%
        mutate(prop1 = ((private)/sum(public, mixed, private, municipal))*100) %>%
        mutate(prop2 = ((private + mixed)/sum(public, mixed, private, municipal))*100) %>%
        left_join(sdf, by = c("canton", "area")) %>%
        select(canton, area, stratio, prop1, prop2) %>%
        ungroup() 
```
The following code book explains the different variables in detail:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
colnames <- c("area", "canton", "stratio", "prop1", "prop2")
explanation <- c("Indicates whether the institutions were in a rural or urban area.", "Indicates the Ecuadorian canton in which the institutions are located.", "Median Student/Teacher ratio, ratios calculated at school level by dividing the number of teachers by the number of students", "Proportion of enrolled students enrolled in private education.", "Proportion of enrolled students enrolled in private and mixed education.")
values <- c("factor of 2 levels: rural, urban", "factor of 222 levels: LOJA, ...", "Numeric", "Numeric", "Numeric")
table <- data.frame(cbind(colnames, explanation, values))
kable(table, caption = "Code Book data frame SDF1")
```

# Results
The following code tests the distribution of the two variables for urban and rural areas. It demonstrates that student-teacher ratios are normally distributed. To the contrary the proportion of private students is not. Nevertheless, by taking the log, we can generate a distribution for both areas which approximates a normal. The log version will therefore be used for the purpose of regression analysis. 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(3,4))
hist(sdf1$prop1[sdf1$area == "rural"], 
     main = "Prop 1. Rural", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(sdf1$prop1[sdf1$area == "urban"], 
     main = "Prop 1. Urban", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(log(sdf1$prop1[sdf1$area == "rural" & sdf1$prop1 > 0]), 
     main = "Log Prop 1. Rural\n(0's removed)", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(log(sdf1$prop1[sdf1$area == "urban" & sdf1$prop1 > 0]), 
     main = "Log Prop 1. Urban\n(0's removed)", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(sdf1$prop2[sdf1$area == "rural"], 
     main = "Prop 2. Rural", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(sdf1$prop2[sdf1$area == "urban"], 
     main = "Prop 2. Urban", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(log(sdf1$prop2[sdf1$area == "rural" & sdf1$prop2 > 0]), 
     main = "Log Prop 2. Rural\n(0's removed)", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(log(sdf1$prop2[sdf1$area == "urban" & sdf1$prop2 > 0]), 
     main = "Log Prop 2. Urban\n(0's removed)", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(sdf1$stratio[sdf1$area == "rural"], 
     main = "ST Ratio Rural", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
hist(sdf1$stratio[sdf1$area == "urban"],
     main = "ST Ratio Urban", xlab = "", breaks = 20)
```

```{r}
sdfprop1<- sdf1[sdf1$prop1 != 0,]
sdfprop2 <- sdf1[sdf1$prop2 != 0,]
data.frame(summary(sdf1$area), set = "total")
data.frame(summary(sdfprop1$area), set = "prop1>0")
data.frame(summary(sdfprop2$area), set = "prop2>0")
```


The following code creates a graph of the relationship of the two variables, as well as its OLS regression with the student-teacher ratio in public schools as the dependent variable and the log of the proportion of private students as the independent variable.
